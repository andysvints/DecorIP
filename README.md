# DecorIP

## Overview

Designed to help you quickly identify and understand public IP addresses. It decorates IP addresses with additional information such as country and ASN (Autonomous System Number) powered by [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io).
This extension does not activate on internal IP addresses, making it particularly useful for reviewing logs and providing additional context about IP addresses. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

## Features

- **IP Decoration**: Automatically decorates public IP addresses in your code with country and ASN information.
